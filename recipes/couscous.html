    <h1>Couscous</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Couscous is made from tiny steamed balls of semolina flour. 
        Though we think of it as a grain, itâ€™s actually a type of pasta.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>salt</li>
        <li>oil</li>
        <li>butter</li>
        <li>semolina</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To start, bring the cooking liquid (preferably a flavorful chicken or vegetable broth) to a boil in a medium pot. Add a drizzle of olive oil, a pat of butter, and a little salt.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, add the couscous. (I use 1-3/4 cups liquid to 1-1/2 cups couscous.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Take the pan off the heat, cover, and let the couscous steam for 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            When you lift the lid, the grains will appear flat in an even layer. Use a fork to fluff it up and break up the clumps for light and fluffy couscous.
